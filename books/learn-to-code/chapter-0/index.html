    This book will teach you how to program a computer
  </h2>
  <p>
    If you put in the time and effort required to understand it, you will be well positioned to get a job as a junior software engineer or build the project you are dreaming of. You are welcome here even if you want neither of those things, but if that is the case I wonder why you're interested, and I wonder if you know why you're interested. If you know your why, then you can get through any challenge computer programming may pose.

    Depth of material
  </h2>
  <p>
    An undergraduate computer science degree takes about four years to complete. In that time a student will have learned many diverse topics and written some five thousand lines of code. The code they wrote will likely have started off clumsy and worked up toward middling, the student will have learned many useful things as well as many they will not use in their career, and they may not have been exposed to any modern languages and frameworks and techniques used in industry.
  </p>
  <p>
    A web development bootcamp takes only three to six months. In that time a student will have learned a few focused topics and written some two thousand lines of code. The code will probably have started off clumsy and become a bit less so, the student will have learned how to use some very specific technologies with industry demand and some that will be imminently out of date, and they may not have internalized the fundamentals that a degree would have instilled in them.
  </p>
  <p>
    This book aims to be somewhere in the middle, as a guide to independent self-learning. Beginners may learn a great deal.

  <h2>
    You have a million things to learn
  </h2>
  <p>
    The undergraduate degree mentioned takes four years. Some students go on to study computer science at the graduate level over the course of many more years. Professionals work in the field for decades. Total yearly compensation at top companies for top engineers is often in the multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars. This is a large, ever growing field. You have a million things to learn.

  <h2>
    You will have to teach yourself
  </h2>
  <p>
    Irrespective of one's educational path, programming especially is a field in which you will have to teach yourself. You will benefit from blog posts, articles, books, classes, teachers, mentors, communities — but, like a novelist or a painter, you will work yourself into your own unique corners. You will want to do something that you've never done before that doesn't fit a pattern you've seen, and you will have to figure out how to make progress. And over and over you will manage to break things in very special ways, and you will have to figure out how to fix them.

    Beginner to expert, that's the gig.

    There's no substitute for time behind the pot
  </h2>
  <p>
    If you want to learn to play the banjo, you have to play the banjo. The big round bottom of the banjo is called the pot, and if you want to get good at the instrument you have to spend a lot of time behind it.

    Running the examples
  </h2>
  <p>
    Every example in this book runs, and they run right in your web browser. Click the links, play around.
    When curiosity moves you, get the examples running on your own computer, and play around further. How? You will have to teach yourself.

  <h2>
    Pedagogical approach
  </h2>
  <p>
    This book dives into programming head first, in ways that I cannot imagine responsible teachers would recommend. The largest sin is that I will be teaching you multiple programming languages simultaneously, of various paradigms. Beyond that, I will jump from topic to topic, from high level to low level, from conceptual to concrete.
  </p>
  <p>
    It will be a bit like sitting with me discussing some code in front of us. I will be indulging my curiosity along the way, and I hope you will indulge yours as well. If you are curious, then you can get through any challenge computer programming may pose.
